	<h2>More About Me</h2>
	<p><b>My Childhood</b></p>
	<p>I was born in Harbel Firestone, and grew up in Smell-No-Taste which is currently called Unification City in Lower Margibi County. I really admired watching planes landing on the Roberts International Airport (RIA). Also, I admired people traveling in different beautiful cars on the Robert Field Highway Road. Later, my family moved in Harbel Firestone because there where my dad is working. I also admired the beautiful and electrified buildings at nights. Moreover, the good living standard and facilities provided by the Firestone Rubber Plantation Company.</p>
